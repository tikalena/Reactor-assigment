The assignment was to make an application that shows the multiple product list in three categories - accessories, jackets, shirts. 
The client can check product availability info from a single UI. 
The requirement was to switch between product categories easily and quickly. 
To do this, I have made three buttons that open straightforward and explicit list with the product name, price, colour and manufacturer.
The client can also check the availability in warehouse by clicking on the "Check Availability" -button.
