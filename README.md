The assignment was to make an application that shows the multiple product list in three categories - accessories, jackets, shirts. 
<br>
The client can check product availability info from a single UI. 
<br>
The requirement was to switch between product categories easily and quickly. 
<br>
To do this, I have made three buttons that open straightforward and explicitlist with the product name, price, color and manufacturer.
<br>
The client can also check the availability in warehouse by clicking on the "Check Availability" -button.
